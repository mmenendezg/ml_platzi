       "' \\n\\nPublic-key cryptography was discovered in 1975 and revolutionized communication security by allowing for secure communication between many subscribers. It was developed by Roger Needham and Martin Hellman and uses one-way and trap-door functions to protect computer passwords. The RSA cryptosystem, using large prime numbers, is one of its implementations. The development of public-key cryptography faced challenges, but it has been used in various applications, including military identification systems. It has also been commercialized by companies such as RSA Data Security and Cylink Corporation. The National Security Agency has also conducted feasibility studies for a new secure phone system using public-key technology. Research in this field is ongoing, with a focus on improving factoring and finding prime numbers. The success of public-key cryptography has delayed the introduction of new systems, and it is widely accepted and used in various secure devices. Mathematician Whitfield Diffie made significant contributions to public-key cryptography, and conferences and publications related to the topic continue to take place.'"
